System User Guide
* After starting the system, choose the desired function. For first-time users, select "Plan Daily Medication" to set up the daily medication schedule.
* The "Query Current Medication Plan" function allows you to view all current settings.
* The "Use" function utilizes the camera to recognize whether the medication is needed for the day. Place the medication in front of the camera, and the system will automatically capture the current date. After recognition, it will provide the medication name, illuminate the "green" LED, and emit a notification sound if it's the correct medication for the day. If it's not the medication for today, it will display "Not Medication" and illuminate the "red" LED.
* The "Add Medication" function allows you to add medications to be taken during the week at any time.
* The "Voice Inquiry" function uses a microphone to receive the user's voice. Users can speak the name of the medication they want to inquire about, and the system will display the days on which the medication needs to be taken. Uttering the keyword "exit" will end this function.
